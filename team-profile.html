							gaming in the late 90s, a time when computer gaming has just started. At that time his ideal
							career was to become a game developer, however, his interest in Music eventually became his
							sole focus where he trained himself as aprofessional musician, the field that he
							currently works in.</p>
						<p>Through his journey for self-development, he started to look for new career opportunities
							that were both Intellectually challenging and presented opportunities for long term career
							development, this is when he turned back to Technology. With skills in Python and JavaScript
							that he was able to learn through Codecademy; and some other self-taught skills in HTML and

							receive a recognised qualification at the end of his studies at RMIT in Information
							Technology.</p>

						<p>A potential influence within a team is the added self-awareness that he can provide.
							Heightened self-awareness may allow everyone in the team to catch when one is behaving in a
							way that is detrimental to the team and give insight as to why this may be the case. When
							working in a team, he is generally very good at taking criticism, this type doesn&rsquo;t
							take things personally and won&rsquo;t get emotional when conflicts do occur. To him,
							warranted criticism is a somewhat practice for them to improve.</p>
