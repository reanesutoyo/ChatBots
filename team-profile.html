							the company, sourcing and processing relevant company data, and construct resolutions for
							customers.</p>

						<p>Marc is a professional musician and Music Educator. A native Aussie with a cultural
							background of Italian and Irish. He enjoys the outdoors and spend most of recreational time
							surfing and swimming whenever possible. His interest in IT started in his interests in
							gaming in the late 90s, a time when computer gaming has just started. At that time his ideal
							career was to become a game developer, however, his interest in Music eventually became his
							sole focus where he trained himself as aprofessional musician, the field that he
							currently works in.</p>
						<p>Through his journey for self-development, he started to look for new career opportunities
							that were both Intellectually challenging and presented opportunities for long term career
							development, this is when he turned back to Technology. With skills in Python and JavaScript
							that he was able to learn through Codecademy; and some other self-taught skills in HTML and
							CSS, he decided to jump back into tertiary study to follow a more structured program and
							receive a recognised qualification at the end of his studies at RMIT in Information
							Technology.</p>
						<h6>INTJ-A</h6>
						<p>A potential influence within a team is the added self-awareness that he can provide.
							Heightened self-awareness may allow everyone in the team to catch when one is behaving in a
							way that is detrimental to the team and give insight as to why this may be the case. When
							working in a team, he is generally very good at taking criticism, this type doesn&rsquo;t
							take things personally and won&rsquo;t get emotional when conflicts do occur. To him,
							warranted criticism is a somewhat practice for them to improve.</p>

						<h3><a name="_Toc69739719"></a>John Hurst</h3>
		
						<p>Student Number:s3882857 Email address:
							<img src="john.jpeg" width="200">
							s3882857@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
						<p>John was born in Sandringham hospital in Victoria, and have spent the majority of his life living in Cheltenham, Victoria. As healthy individual whose main interests and hobbies have always been exercise, Science, Technology, weight-lifting, and is a great home-cook. The more knowledge acquired from exercise and working out, the more he realises how important life- style, health, and tasty foods keeps you on the move. Beyond that, science and technology have always been become John’s intellectual passions, this started during his adolescent years, when he became obsessed with arcade games. With the encouragement of his parents and his sister who was a computer programmer, John had experience with coding at a very young age. However, life is not always as planned, after a lack of lustre, or underachieving finish to his High School year, he found himself working in bank which was never his interest. </p>
						<p>But determined, john completed his first advanced diploma in IT in 1998. John began working as a programmer and is well experienced with older languages such as PIC and BBX,  with a level expertise in Java and JavaScript. As technology evolves as a rapid speed, it lead john to realise that he wanted to a university degree that would further progress his career and passion in IT.  .</p>
							<h6>INTJ-A</h6>
						<p>Like Marc from our group, John is also an “Architect” with an INTJ-A personality. John finds joy working alone, getting work done is a swift when he is working by himself. However, when working in a team, he keeps the group organised, scheduled, and future focused just like he is, adding a sense of self-awareness that allows everyone to get on the game. Like the passion with programming, when he has an target, it is long-lived, and he will stick with that target/purpose for a long time, any short lived plans for him is just a waste of time. Effectively fulfilling the ultimate goals of the team in a consistent manner. </p>
