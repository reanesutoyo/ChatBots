							<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739736"></a>Justin Healy</h2>
						<p>What our group has done well so far has been our ability to stick to our deadlines. During
							our meetings we have specified which work was needed to be completed and when. So far, we
							have all stuck to these deadlines and have been able to offer our pieces of work to the
							group for absorption into the collective.</p>
						<p>What could be improved in our team, is our ability to schedule meetings. Most of our meetings
							have been organised the day of, or the day before. We could improve by having a more
							structured meeting system.</p>
						<p>The thing that has surprised me about this experience is the same thing I have I learnt. It
							is that it takes time to settle into a groove with a group, even when all communication is
							online. I expected this part to be much easier as an online experience, but it is
							essentially how it would be if we were physically in a classroom together. We all had to
							find our way of contributing our parts and find our place in the team.</p>
						<p>In the way we structured GitHub, we used teams to host and edit all our sections, then when
							completed, these could be pushed to GitHub for web hosting.</p>

						<p>For Group #14, Assessment task 2, the group was amazing. Everyone in the group was kind and
							supportive, and there wasn&rsquo;t a single malicious or hostile member of the group. The
							group came together and welcomed each member of the group extremely well and the group
							divided up the workpretty well. However, from personal experience in the group, I
							didn&rsquo;t do much, if any. The work I was assigned, I was doing the IT work interviews,
							however, instead of interviewing an IT Professional personally, I took various interviews of
							different kinds of IT Professionals over the last 20 odd years and was going to compare
							them. I was doing relatively well in this when a group member reached out in the group
							stating he&rsquo;d done the interview. After a few days of lack of communication on my part
							to the rest of the group, I returned to see that the group was ready to cut me out of the
							Assessment.There&rsquo;reno hard feelings towards this, I had done little to the
							group. However, upon my return, there was a conscious effort on the group&rsquo;s part to
							include me back into the group, and tohelp outwith anything to get my
							contribution up, which was surprising, and comforting. I&rsquo;m not a very sociable
							individual, but to find such a warm and welcoming group of people for this assessment, was
							good.</p>
						<p></p>
						<h2><a name="_Toc69739738"></a>Alice w lin</h2>
						<p>In general, I enjoy group work, and although a lot of unexpected events occurred with missing
							team members, and us unable to have meetings according to everyone&rsquo;s time schedules
							etc.; it was still very enjoyable. The great thing about teamwork is that you can share your
							ideas, your questions, and your concerns with what you are doing with the others in the
							team, ultimately working together to achieve a common goal, that is to finish the assignment
							as best as we can!</p>
						<p>Another aspect I think our team did very well is that we split the sections among each member
							in the start very carefully before we started doing anything. From my experience, no matter
							if this is related work or study, it is important to trust your team, and you must assign
							each section properly to avoid unnecessary disagreements. We tried our best at assigning the
							sections equally, although it didn&rsquo;t really work as we intended, and there are some
							that might have done more work than others, there was no conflict. I think Everyone
							tried very hard, and everyone in our team is extremely bright and hardworking,
							everyone&rsquo;s got their own ideas and opinions, everyone had their skills to share with
							everyone else, making this experience particular enjoyable. Overall, the general experience
							for assignment 2 is very well enjoyed, and I would do another assignment with everyone in no
							time.</p>
