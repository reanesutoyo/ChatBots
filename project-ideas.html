						<h2><a name="_Toc69739728"></a>Project name: Design and Implementation of FAQ based AI-driven
							Chatbot for COVID-19 Assistance</h2>
						<p>By Alice W Lin</p>
						<h3><a name="_Toc69739729"></a>Summary</h3>
						<p>The coronavirus Pandemic 2019 outbreak has made it obligatory for all healthcare providers to
							adapt to changing health circumstances. Disease control centers have encouraged hospitals
							and healthcare providers to search for innovative ways to switch to online modes for
							providing proper healthcare. Because of the rapidly spreading Corona Virus, people are bound
							to their homes. In this manner, chatbots have proven to be a blessing in disguise that can
							assist in screening processes of the patient in a scalable manner. This project is about
							creating and implementing a chatbot that would help patients worldwide with questions about
							the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients will ask their queries regarding the symptoms of
							corona and get help from the chatbot using voice input and voice output. The creation of
							chatbots will be based on &ldquo;Natural Language Processing (NLP)&rdquo; and
							&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&rdquo;. This chatbot can be deployed at various
							healthcare facilities. The chatbot would also be beneficial for those who have a speech
							disability.</p>
						<h3><a name="_Toc67404653"></a><a name="_Toc69739730"></a>Motivation</h3>
						<p>The coronavirus pandemic can be considered as the accelerator and motivation behind creating
							and implementing chatbots, having the ability to help people globally to ask their queries
							while being at home in their safety and comfort zone following the COVID-19 SOPs as well as
							social distancing. Keeping in view the benefits of these chatbots beyond pandemic in the
							healthcare sector, the adoption of such a developed form of chatbots will continue to grow
							in the future. Patients, especially from far-off places, would not have to travel a long
							distance just for a simple checkup that eventually not only saves their time but their money
							also. Besides this, there are a lot of other people who are not capable of speaking or even
							hearing. They find it difficult to explain their health problems to the doctors. This whole
							thought process motivated me to design an &ldquo;automatic speech recognition (ASR)&rdquo;
							and &ldquo;Text to speech (TTS)&rdquo; based chatbot that would help not only other users
							but also those who have some kind of speech or hearing disability, so that, maximum people
							can benefit from this technology [1].</p>
						<h3><a name="_Toc67404654"></a><a name="_Toc69739731"></a>Project Description</h3>
						<h4><a name="_Toc67404655"></a>Chatbot Feature</h4>
						<p>A chatbot makes an interaction with the human through instant messaging, artificially
							imitating the human interaction pattern. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms make
							computers acquire knowledge on their own without programming. Chatbots develop the ability
							to comprehend the natural language (text or speech). Therefore, a chatbot is some sort of
							AI-based computer program that pretends to be a human to initiate the conversation with
							actual humans. Primarily, it allows starting a conversation between machine and human using
							Text-to-speech or Speech-to-text messages.</p>
						<p>One of the important and significant features of the chatbot is that it works independently
							without human intervention and provides answers to the queries using a combination of
							already defined scripts and natural language processing [2].</p>
						<p>Chatbots can store all the information to be used in the future. They are built on networking
							algorithms or AI-based machine learning (ML) techniques to get to the right conclusion.
							Besides memorizing the provided user&rsquo;s data, chatbots possess the feature to adjust
							their language as well as the voice tones on the basis of the content of the discussion,
							personalization, and advanced user experience. A fully designed chatbot having progressive
							features is capable of providing solutions and suggestions about every type of healthcare
							issue based on past interactions.</p>
						<p>In the case of the COVID -19 pandemic, chatbots provide strong potential for thoughtfully
							organized information in the healthcare sectors. The curated information is personalized as
							per the needs and symptoms of each patient. The chatbots can respond to particular questions
							in a highly interactive manner, more quickly than the conventional online searching methods
							[3].</p>
						<p>The adoption of chatbots for providing information regarding COVID -19 can overcome the
							burden of reception of hospitals. The coherent feature of a chatbot for checking corona
							symptoms will reduce the rapidly increasing cases in emergency wards and units.</p>
						<h4><a name="_Toc67404656"></a>Open Source Chatbot Tools for COVID-19</h4>
						<p>To tackle the COVID -19 pandemic, several organizations have generated a list of open-source
							chatbot software tools that can be used to build recovery plans [4].</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CDC COVID -19 Health Bot: It gathers autonomous screening protocols from organizations.
							</li>
							<li>Maladie Coronavirus: A chatbot-based open-source questionnaire comprising of 23
								questions about symptoms, history, physical attributes, etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4><a name="_Toc67404657"></a>Skills Required to Build Chatbot</h4>
						<p>To build a chatbot for the healthcare sector, the software developer must have an in-depth
							understanding of several programming languages as well as recent technologies. Some of the
							essential skills that a chatbot developer requires to have are as follows [5]:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Frameworks for chatbot development: The developer must be proficient in using anyone of
								the following frameworks to build chatbots from the scratch: &ldquo;Microsoft Azure Bot
								Service&rdquo;, API.ie, &ldquo;IBM Watson&rdquo;, etc.</li>
							<li>Technological Skills: Developers must be fully familiarized with the use of Artificial
								intelligence (AI), &ldquo;Natural language Processing&rdquo; and Machine Learning
								Techniques.</li>
							<li>Programming languages: Chatbot developers are highly recommended to have in-depth
								knowledge about various programming languages. These programming languages can be Java,
								PHP, Python, Ruby.</li>
							<li>Mobile messaging App: Chatbot/ software developers must be acquainted with distinct
								platforms to incorporate chatbots. The example of such platforms is WhatsApp chatbots,
								Skype, Facebook messenger, etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><a name="_Toc67404658"></a><a name="_Toc69739732"></a>Project Outcome</h3>
						<p>The project of implementing a FAQ-based AI-driven chatbot will have a positive outcome in
							various sectors but in the healthcare industry, it will prove to be a blessing in disguise
							in this time of pandemic when following SOPs and keeping social distancing is very essential
							for safety, particularly for elderly people. The beneficial outcome of a chatbot is as
							follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>With AI-powered chatbots for the COVID-19 pandemic, patients can attain better solutions
								for their COVID related symptoms.</li>
							<li>Other than providing help for coronavirus queries, the implementation of chatbots in the
								health sector can streamline several administrative tasks by overcoming their burden.
							</li>
							<li>The implementation of a chatbot will make users get a quick response along with a better
								solution without waiting for a long duration in a queue. The patient would not have to
								take a week-long doctor appointment for check-ups.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3><a name="_Toc69739733"></a>Possible funding sources</h3>
						<img class="m-img-responsive" src="images/profit.jpg" alt="profit">
						<h4>For Profit Investment Funds</h4>
						<img class="m-img-responsive" src="images/hotel-resort.jpg" alt="">
						<p><a href="https://laviehotels.com/">https://laviehotels.com/</a></p>
						<p>Although not in the health industry, La vie Hotels offers investors guaranteed return on
							their investments. Due to the recent COVID-19 strike, most investors are now hesitant to put
							their planned initial investment into the travel and hospitality industry. This spare money
							that they now have afloat has potential that we can put in good use. There is potential for
							large profit returns as well as the positive social impact that it might have which may be
							very appealing to our current investors. But of cos timing is a huge concern, like any
							business ideas, the right timing to release a product is vital, and if our team is able to
							successfully come up with exact dates that manufacturing can start within the height of this
							pandemic, the initial funding can be secured through this route.</p>
						<h4>Non-profit Investment Funds</h4>
						<img class="m-img-responsive" src="images/non-profit.png" alt="non profit">
						<p>Other Investment funds such as the non-profit Global Innovation Funding (GIF) can also be a
							potential funding source that might be interested in such project. According to the world
							bank group, the heaviest impact of COVID-19 are among the poorest countries [7]. GIF was set
							up to confront global development challenges by funding innovations with the potential to
							improve the lives of the world&rsquo;s poorest people; and COVID-19 related innovations that
							might deliver solutions to these developing countries are definitely something GIF might be
							potentially interested in [8].</p>
						<p>Projects such as the &ldquo;Health Connect&rdquo; by Praekelt and Idinsight based in South
							Africa is one of those projects that GIF has supported with a grant of $500K USD.
							Similar to our AI Chatbot, &ldquo;Health Connect&rdquo; is a mobile application that
							allows users to self-diagnose COVID-19 and seek advice based on their personal circumstances
							and symptoms [9]. This technology however unlike our very smart AI driven chatbot, is not AI
							driven, and works more of a command based software that replies the same answer for a
							particular query. The project received $500K USD grant from GIF proves the feasibility of
							the Chatbot project.</p>
						<h3><a name="_Toc69739734"></a>Project Sustainability and The Future Of Chatbots in Health</h3>
						<h4>idea 1: Chatbot &ndash; Health Administrator</h4>
						<p>The COVID-19 Chatbot project on the surface seems like a rather short business idea. What
							will happen when the pandemic ends or eventually is under control? The answer would be
							migrating this technology into other areas of the health industry, potentially patients can
							have easy access to medication guidance, symptom checks, simple checkups, medical queries,
							nutrition and so on. Patients can turn to chatbots in an instance, allowing Chatbots to be
							the first line of support for medical enquiries, and even replacing human doctors and
							medical staff in some cases, allowing busy organizations to deploy staff elsewhere. Patients
							will then be directed to Health professionals and Specialists when they fail to handle their
							issues.</p>
						<h4>IDEA 2: Chatbot &ndash; Home Healthcare Market</h4>
						<p>According to Precedence research, the global Home Healthcare Market is worth around US$
							167.28 billion in 2020, and expected to grow to US$ 383.66 billion by 2030 [11]. The
							COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the widespread of telehealth, and home healthcare
							visits. The following are the potential resolutions Chatbots can provide to solve Home
							Healthcare issues:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>At Home Patient Monitoring: Chatbots can notify local healthcare institutions when
								patients of Chatbots providers are in situations that are unsafe; and give guidance and
								monitor effectiveness of certain medications.</li>
							<li>Patience convenience and easy Access: Reduces patient wait times doctors, only when
								Chatbot is unable to resolve issue for patient, a local doctor will be scheduled.</li>
							<li>Secure Communication: Through identification, two-factor authentication and
								authorization, end-to-end encryptions, network secure protocols, and self-destructive
								messages, etc.</li>
							<li>Easy access to Medical History and Patient Information. Through cloud-based
								technologies.</li>
							<li>Easy billing management: Chatbots gives easy access for patients their payment history
								and payments due, and make payments and request additional information solving potential
								billing errors.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>IDEA 3: &ldquo;Hello Mate&rdquo; Chatbot &ndash; Your Mental Health Assistant</h4>
						<p>According to WHO, the guardian news outlet mentions that from 2005-15, cases of depressive
							illness increased by nearly a fifth, and within 10 years, the link between suicide, and
							depression is clear - which is now the second leading cause of death for young people aged
							15-29 [10]. As an individual who has suffered with depression myself, I understand the
							emotional struggles when you have no one to turn to, and Chatbots might just be the
							solution. Chatbots could just be the scalable solution that can provide integrative means of
							engaging with individuals, providing a venue to replace traditional counselling, reducing
							wait-times, and providing immediate relief for patients who can now express their emotions
							and gain support through therapeutic conversations with Chatbots.</p>
						<p>The potential to utilize the Artificial intelligence in Chatbots, the smart algorithms in
							AI-powered chatbots are now able to conduct emotional conversations through auditory or
							textual methods, empathizing with human&rsquo;s behaviors and feelings. The &ldquo;Hello
							Mate&rdquo; 1st generation Chatbot is created after the end of COVID-19. Compared to some of
							the popular AI voice assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri, the &ldquo;Hello
							Mate&rdquo; can burst you into laughter with his personalized sarcastic replies, help you
							get your tasks done; scheduling meetings, setting the alarm, book a cab or ordering your
							favourite meals. More importantly, he is able to actively engage in real-time conversations
							with you using the conversational user interface backed by artificial intelligence (AI),
							machine leaning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). This combined technology enables
							&ldquo;Hello Mate&rdquo; to continuously learn from their assigned patients (us humans,) be
							intellectually independent.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Hello Mate&rdquo; Would be able to:</p>
						<p>Make conversations with patients who are affected by a mental health issue or is just looking
							for company or assistant.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Backed by AI&rsquo;s cognitive ability, Hello Mate is able to attend to and manage the
								psychological and emotional state of their</li>
							<li>Directly engage and empathies with their users, building a relationship, and fostering
								better communication with their users.</li>
							<li>Gives users recommendations regarding to their psychological wellbeing and provide users
								with direct users to the correct treatment that has been validated and supported by
								research.</li>
							<li>Provide Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBD) - AI designed with intense collaboration of
								psychologists and therapists, providing a range of issues such as depression, anxiety,
								alcohol and drug use problems, relationship and social issues, eating disorders and
								other mental illnesses [12].</li>
							<li>Providing support 24/7.</li>
							<li>Ultimately this technology is to not replace psychologists, and mental health
								professionals, but would act more like an addition to those that are not lucky to have
								access to these services.</li>
