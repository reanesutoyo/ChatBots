						<p>No, like what I said in my profiles, my ideal job isn’t necessarily a specific position. My ideal “job” would be to create my own IT company/product/service in the future. This is not one specific job, more like a combination of jobs not only having IT skills, which is core, but also areas like your skills at management, marketing, source of funding, employ the right people, the right timing, etc and etc. Why I chose “shopping technical specialist” position is quite simple, <br>
							</p>
							<p>
								it was because it is in Google, I want that experience of working in one of the largest companies in the world, preferably a position that interacts with people, even better a position that allows me to build connections with other workers and clients in the company. Of cos if there is any other opportunities for other positions, I would still take it as long as it’s from one of these companies Google/Facebook/Apple and in San Francisco.

							JUSTIN HEALY 
						</h4>
						<strong>QA Tester/ Test analyst  </strong>
						<br>
						Opinion:  <br>
						<p>
							No, my opinion has not changed since viewing the burning glass data. Test analyst is ranked number 11 regarding job postings, and the skills required are also high on the rankings, JavaScript, Java, SQL etc. Although these skills are desired for positions other than as a test analyst, QA tester. But to be develop proficiency with these skills through testing would also help me in the software development world if my career path changed in that direction.

						<h4>
							JAMES STATHAKIS
						</h4>
						<strong>Cyberspace Analyst  </strong>
						<br>
							Opinion:  <br>
						<p>
							Upon viewing the burning glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. Heading into the new era of information and technological advancement, cyberspace analysts, or more specifically, Cybersecurity workers are more sought after than ever before, and beside being a fascination on my behalf, it also has high demand. The demand for a job such as this stems from both the civilian/industry market but also military contractors and ranks/positions.

							REANE NADINA SUTOYO 
						</h4>
						<strong>
							UX and UI designer and Front-End Website Developer 
						</strong>
						<br>
						Opinion: <br>
						 <p>
							Since web developer is rank 6th in the top occupations in burning glass data, I felt that there is still lots of demand for web developer which it’s good to know. However, I think I will need to focus my effort to learn more about web development which mean I will need to learn about the database and back-end web development as well.  My opinion of my ideal job changed a bit and I understand that I must be a full stack developer to be successful as website developer.

						<h4>
							JOHN LINDSAY HURST 
						</h4>
						<strong>General Developer\Computer Programmer </strong>
						<br>
						Opinion:  <br>
						<p>
							I have become a little more focused on specific program languages. Java, JavaScript, etc. However, Python is still on my radar. I am also thinking about whether to continue with Information Technology. I’m not sure about Computer Science. I need to investigate Software Engineering as well. I think that is a purer stream of programming. For now, there is considerable time to decide.
              When I study the most popular Jobs and Job skills, I try not to think about it in that light. Rather the skills that are least required could also be the niche difference as to getting the right job. More emphasis should be on what I am interested in and want to do. I think, if I do that, then I am more likely to be successful (Job wise) in life.
						</p>
						<h4>
							MARC VALPIANI 
						</h4>
						<strong>Full-Stack Developer  </strong>
						<br>
						Opinion:  <br>
						<p>
							My opinion has not changed drastically after looking at the burning glass data. I am still in the early stages of my studies and want to keep my options as open as possible. From my early assignments, I have enjoyed working on Java projects more than with HTML and CSS, which suggests that I might be more suited to being more focused on back-end rather than aiming to be full-stack. I prefer working on refining the logic of a program rather than focusing on presentation and user experience. For this reason, I would consider being a software engineer/developer which ranked 1st out of all job postings by a significant margin.
