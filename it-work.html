							<h2>IT works?</h2>

						</header>

						<p>The general work duties of this IT Professional cover a variety of roles. They encompass many
							facets of the business. Essentially, programming is his main function, but at the same time,
							it is a minor part of the role. He has greater responsibilities for the overall functioning
							of the business's IT services. Ensuring the business is able to meet the demands of its
							customers and to continue to do so well into the future.</p>
						<p>The daily work may involve everything from developing code, debugging, operating systems
							maintenance, and networking issues. However, greater emphasis on managing the environments
							that keep all of this running. He describes this as working with ERP Systems or Enterprise
							Resource Planning.</p>
						<p>ERP is usually referred to as a category of business management software&mdash;typically a
							suite of integrated applications&mdash;that an organization can use to collect, store,
							manage, and interpret data from many business activities.</p>
						<p>The majority of these IT Systems are financial applications. They are, Accounts Receivable,
							Accounts Payable, Warehouse Management and Inventory Management systems. The environments in
							which these systems live, rely upon many other environments. These include, testing
							environments, development environments, and production environments. He is relied upon to
							consult, manage, and develop all of these environments.</p>
						<p>In short, and I quote, "Yeah, so pretty much everything technical I I'll look after...".</p>
						<p></p>

								<h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The company&rsquo;s IT Systems are largely owned by Microsoft. Often this leads to
								interactions with the technical and programming personnel from this company.</p>
							<p>When a challenging issue is raised without any real progress made on it, then he becomes
								the, 'escalation point' for support personnel, testing personnel and functional project
								management personnel. He is the 'Go-To' person.</p>
							<p>Most of all, other programmers, project managers, functional consultants, and other
								environment managers of the company are the primary interactions he has.</p>
							<p>He reports directly to a manager who is described as a, 'functional operations manager
								for the business'. He has occasional dealings with senior management, but this rarely
								occurs.</p>
							<p>He does interact with third party software development companies and therefore the
								technical and programming personnel of these companies.</p>
							<p>He has no direct contact with customers or clients.</p>

								<h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This IT Professional spends the bulk of his time in an office environment. This can
								encompass a variety of areas. It is not just an office job. The company is spread out
								across a large geographical area. The interactions required of him result in
								considereable movements away from the main office. Meetings and technical interactions
								are often off site at end user locations. He is not pigeonholed as a programmer in a
								development capacity only. Managerial requirements demand many off site visitations and
								dealings with all levels of company personnel.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<header>
								<h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this role he is the 'Go-To' person. He is expected to know the answer to a problem. He
								does not always have the answer. This becomes the most challenging part of the job. He
								cannot esculate a problem to someone higher than himself. He must endeavour to find a
								solution on his own.</p>
							<p>In past job roles he was always able to find a more technical person than himself.
								Software houses always had other developers that he could interact with and bounce ideas
								off of. In this role, he is it. He is expected to solve the problem.</p>
							<p>Solving the more obscure or less known technical problems is the most challenging.
								Researching and investigating these issues is however, the most rewarding and most
								challenging part of the job.</p>
